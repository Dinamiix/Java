I am Iliyan Karanikolov, 23 years old, from Sofia. I am currently studying the Java programming language at SoftUni, and I will soon familiarize myself with Spring. 
The courses I have completed have provided me with a solid foundation for a career as a programmer, but I realize that I need more practical experience to reinforce what I have learned.

I am looking for a company that is dedicated to supporting and guiding young programmers like me in the initial steps of their careers in the IT field.
During my training, I had the opportunity to work with motivated individuals, sharing ideas and collaboratively solving challenging tasks. This collaboration taught me to value good communication and teamwork.

I am always seeking opportunities for personal and professional development. I am open to constructive feedback and believe it is an essential element for growth.
Additionally, I consider adaptability to be key to a programmer's successâ€”I quickly adjust to new technologies and methodologies, which allows me to be effective in various environments.

I enjoy challenges related to solving complex problems and always strive to view situations from different angles to find the most optimal solution.
I aim to write clean and organized code that is easy for other team members to maintain and follow, guided by my instructors' advice.
